# EduZenith Student Management System
***By Rizoan Hossain and Nafia tabassum Shouty***

EduZenith is a comprehensive **educational management system** designed to streamline the interaction between **students, teachers, and administrators**. It offers three distinct panels with role-specific features, ensuring a smooth academic and administrative experience. EduZenith was build using ASP.net MVC framework with Software engineering principles and analysis.


The project encompasses a comprehensive educational management system with three
distinct panels:

- Student,
- Teacher, and
- admin.
  
Each panel is equipped with specific functionalities tailored to their roles. Users access these
panels via a main dashboard, where they can log in and manage their activities. Key features
include:

- student and teacher registration,
- course enrollment (Available Courses, Enrolled Courses),
- grading systems for teachers,
- and robust administrative controls for
❖ managing student,
❖ managing teacher and
❖ managing courses
The system ensures efficient management of student enrollments, course offerings, and
academic interactions, enhancing overall educational administration and user experience.
